Fabienbk's ScalaJS facade to Pixi.js
====================================

The aim of this project is to provide a ScalaJS facade for Pixi.js, a 2D library 
that works across all devices.  Pixi.js has full 
[WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) support and seamlessly falls back 
to HTML5's [canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element) if needed. It's 
quite awesome, and ScalaJS makes it awesomer.

### Version? 

It's currently targeting Pixi.js v4.0.3.

### Is it tested?

I'm working on it :) 

### Installation ###

Once you've setup your ScalaJS project, simply add this to your dependencies:

    libraryDependencies += "com.fbksoft" %%% "pixi-scala-js" % "1.0"

### Demos ###

An example is packaged in this repo. See the example package.
